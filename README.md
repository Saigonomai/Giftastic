## What is this?
This Web Application is a program that takes a topic given through provided buttons and looks for 10 relevant gifs from Giphy.com and displays them on the page. The user can also submit their own topics to be buttons.

## How to get started
When the webpage first loads, a list of buttons will appear that provide pre-entered topics that can be used to search Giphy.
When one of these buttons is pressed, a search is started and the screen will display 10 relevant results along with their rating.
Finally, a user can submit a topic by entering it in the right-side form, and submitting the form.
